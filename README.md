# [google\_translate\_cli]()

**google\_translate\_cli** is a bash script that enables users to use Google translate from command line. I find it quicker than opening a web browser and visit the google translate page.

Do not hesitate to contact me in case of questions!

## Quick start

you can use the script as follow:

```
$ ./translate.sh [input language] [output_language] [sentence]
```

for instance if you want to translate "Hello comrade" in Russian, you would write:

```
$ ./translate.sh en ru "Hello comrad"
```

as a result you will get:

```
$ Здравствуйте товарищ
```
